/*! \defgroup environment Environment variables
Environment variables applicable to grib_api:

\b GRIB_API_DEBUG - If set to 1, it will enable debug level logging messages to be displayed by the library.

\b GRIB_API_FAIL_IF_LOG_MESSAGE - If set to 1, it will cause the library to exit when an error or warning is encountered.

\b GRIB_API_IO_BUFFER_SIZE - Defines the size in bytes of the buffer used in the IO calls from Fortran and in the tools.

\b GRIB_API_NO_ABORT - When set to 1 it causes grib_api not to abort execution on failing asserts.

\b GRIB_API_WRITE_ON_FAIL - When set to 1 it will write the last processed grib message in a file named $PID_$FILEID_error.grib on failure in a fortran function used without the return code argument.

\b GRIB_DEFINITION_PATH - Set to the folder containing the set of definition files you want grib_api to use instead of the default one.

\b GRIB_GRIBEX_MODE_ON - When set to 1 it will enable the GRIBEX compatibility mode and grib_api will produce GRIB messages readable by GRIBEX.

\b GRIB_IEEE_PACKING - Accepted values 32 or 64 for 32 or 64 bits IEEE floating point respectively. The GRIB message produced will contain data written in IEEE floating point without packing.

\b GRIB_SAMPLES_PATH - Set to the folder containing the set of samples you want grib_api to use instead of the default one.

\b GRIB_TEMPLATES_PATH - Now obsolete. See GRIB_SAMPLES_PATH.
