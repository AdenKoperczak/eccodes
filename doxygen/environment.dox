/*! \defgroup environment Environment variables
Environment variables applicable to ecCodes:

\b ECCODES_DEBUG - If set to 1, it will enable debug level logging messages to be displayed by the library.

\b ECCODES_FAIL_IF_LOG_MESSAGE - If set to 1, it will cause the library to exit when an error or warning is encountered.

\b ECCODES_IO_BUFFER_SIZE - Defines the size in bytes of the buffer used in the IO calls from Fortran and in the tools.

\b ECCODES_NO_ABORT - When set to 1 it causes ecCodes not to abort execution on failing asserts.

\b ECCODES_GRIB_WRITE_ON_FAIL - When set to 1 it will write the last processed GRIB message in a file named $PID_$FILEID_error.grib on failure in a fortran function used without the return code argument.

\b ECCODES_DEFINITION_PATH - Set to the folder containing the set of definition files you want ecCodes to use instead of the default one.

\b ECCODES_GRIBEX_MODE_ON - When set to 1 it will enable the GRIBEX compatibility mode and ecCodes will produce GRIB messages readable by GRIBEX.

\b ECCODES_GRIB_IEEE_PACKING - Accepted values 32 or 64 for 32 or 64 bits IEEE floating point respectively. The GRIB message produced will contain data written in IEEE floating point without packing.

\b ECCODES_SAMPLES_PATH - Set to the folder containing the set of samples you want ecCodes to use instead of the default one.
